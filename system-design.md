# üß© Job Dashboard System Design Documentation

## üìò Overview

The **Job Dashboard Application** provides an interface for users to **monitor, filter, and manage job executions**.  
It allows users to:
- View job execution history and details.
- Sort and filter jobs by columns (Client, Status, etc.).
- Retry failed jobs directly from the dashboard.
- Optionally add new jobs for execution.

This system integrates with an **Execution Engine (CTS Managed)** that triggers **PowerAgent** for actual job execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Job Monitoring** | Display list of jobs with detailed metadata and execution results. |
| **Filtering & Sorting** | Enable users to filter by client, status, or execution date and sort columns dynamically. |
| **Retry Mechanism** | Users can retry failed jobs using a retry icon in the dashboard. |
| **Add New Job** | Users can create new job requests (optional). |
| **Secure Connection** | Database connection securely retrieved from **Azure Key Vault**. |
| **Observability** | All key actions are logged and traced using **OpenTelemetry**. |

## üß© Components and Responsibilities

| Component | Description | Managed By |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Streamlit Dashboard** | User interface built in Python for viewing, filtering, and retrying jobs. | Y/Z |
| **SQL Server** | Central database storing all job metadata, parameters, and execution states. | Infrastructure / DBA |
| **Execution Engine** | Runs the `jobexecuter.exe` program to trigger PowerAgent jobs. | X |
| **jobexecuter.exe** | Python-based executable responsible for reading jobs from DB and triggering PowerAgent. | X |
| **PowerAgent** | Executes actual jobs or workflows and updates SQL Server upon completion. | X |
| **Azure Key Vault** | Stores secrets and connection strings securely for database access. | Infrastructure |
| **OpenTelemetry** | Used for logging, tracing, and performance monitoring across all layers. | Y/Z |

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

### **Table: Jobs**

| Column | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Client** | VARCHAR(100) | Client identifier |
| **JobID** | INT (PK) | Unique job identifier |
| **JobName** | VARCHAR(200) | Name of the job |
| **Parameters** | VARCHAR(MAX) | Parameters passed to the job (comma-separated) |
| **Status** | VARCHAR(50) | Current status (Pending, Running, Success, Failed) |
| **Message** | VARCHAR(MAX) | Message or error details |
| **ExecutedDateTime** | DATETIME | Last execution time |
| **RefNum** | VARCHAR(50) | Reference number for correlation |

---

## üîÑ Data Flow

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Server** | User triggers retry or adds new job. The record is inserted or updated in the `Jobs` table. |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Server ‚Üí Execution Engine** | The X-managed Execution Engine reads pending/retry jobs. |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Engine ‚Üí PowerAgent** | The engine triggers PowerAgent to execute the job. |
| **4Ô∏è‚É£ PowerAgent ‚Üí SQL Server** | PowerAgent updates the job status, message, and execution details in SQL Server. |
| **5Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Server ‚Üí Dashboard** | Streamlit UI fetches updated job data and refreshes the table view. |

---

## üîê Authentication & Security

- **Authentication** is handled using **Azure Identity**.
- Streamlit app and executer use **Managed Identity** or **Service Principal** to access:
  - Azure Key Vault (for connection string retrieval)
  - SQL Server (via Azure AD authentication)
- No credentials are stored in plain text or code.

---

## üìä Observability with OpenTelemetry

- **Dashboard Telemetry**: Captures user interactions like job retries, job addition, and filtering actions.
- **Executor Telemetry**: Tracks PowerAgent trigger requests, latency, and success/failure spans.
- **Trace Export**: Data is exported via OTLP to **Azure Monitor** or **Application Insights**.

## üß© Summary

This Job Dashboard provides a **centralized, secure, and observable** platform to manage and track job executions efficiently.  
It ensures **clear separation of responsibilities** between **Y/Z** (application ownership) and **X** (execution ownership), while maintaining transparency and control through **SQL Server and Streamlit UI**.
